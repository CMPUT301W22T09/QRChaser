# QRChaser

An android app developed for CMPUT 301 at the University of Alberta.

This app allowed users to scan QR codes and get points based on the hash that they contained in order to compete on a global leaderboard. After scanning a QR code, ea user could then upload information about said qr-code (Its name, location, and image) This data, as well as each user's profile and score was stored in a firebase database and accessed live in the app.
